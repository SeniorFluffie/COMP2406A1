All Star - Smash Mouth

Some[G]body once to[D]ld me the wo[Am]rld is gonna ro[C]ll me
I ai[G]n't the sharpest to[D]ol in the sh[Am]ed   [C]
She was l[G]ooking kinda du[D]mb with her fi[Am]nger and her
[C]Thumb in the s[G]hape of an "[D]L" on her fo[Am]rehead   [C]
We[G]ll the years start coming and they[D] don't stop coming
[Am]Back to the rules and I h[C]it the ground running
Di[G]dn't make sense not to li[D]ve for fun
Your[Am] brain gets smart but yo[C]ur head gets dumb
So[G] much to do so[D] much to see
So [Am]what's wrong with taking the b[C]ack streets
You[G]'ll never know if you do[D]n't go
You[Am]'ll never shine if you d[C]on't glow
                                    
Chorus:
[G]Hey now you're an A[D]ll Star get [Am]your game on, g[C]o play
[G]Hey now you're a Ro[D]ck Star get [Am]the show on get[C] paid
[G]And all that g[D]litters is g[Am]old
[C]Only shooting st[G]ars br[F]eak the mol[C]d
                                    
It'[G]s a cool place and they s[D]ay it gets colder
You[Am]'re bundled up now [C]but wait 'til you get older
But [G]the media men beg to [D]differ
Judging by the ho[Am]le in the satellite [C]picture
The ice we sk[G]ate is getting pretty [D]thin
The waters getting w[Am]arm so you might as well s[C]wim
My world's on f[G]ire how about yo[D]urs
That's the [Am]way I like it and I never get b[C]ored

[G]I said yep what a c[D]oncept I could us[Am]e a little fuel my[C]self
And we c[G]ould all use[D] a little ch[Am]ange     [C]
